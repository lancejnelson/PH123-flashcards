Explain how it works.\nWhat is a hydraulic lift? Explain how it works.\nWhat is atmospheric pressure on Earth?\nWhat is Pascal’s principle?\nWhat is the density of air at standard temperature and pressure (STP)?\nWhat is the density of water at standard temperature and pressure (STP)?\nWhat is the difference between gauge and absolute pressure?\nWhat is the mathematical definition of (equation for) pressure?\nWhat is the mathematical equation for the pressure at depth  \\(h\\) in a fluid?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile at the beach, you push a beach ball under the surface of the water and notice that it is quite hard to keep submerged. What is exerting an upward force on the ball. (Don’t just say buoyant force!!)\nWhat determines whether an object float or sinks when placed in a fluid?\nTwo blocks are identical in size. One is made of lead and sits on the bottom of a pond; the other is made of wood and floats on top. Upon which block is the buoyant force greater? Explain.\nWhat is Archimedes’ principle?"
