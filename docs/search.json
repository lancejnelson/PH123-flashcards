    "text": "Explain how a suction cup works.\nExplain why gases exert pressure.\nExplain why liquids exert pressure.\nWhat are the SI units of density?\nWhat are the SI units of pressure?\nWhat is a barometer? Explain how it works.\nWhat is a hydraulic lift? Explain how it works.\nWhat is atmospheric pressure on Earth?\nWhat is Pascal’s principle?\nWhat is the density of air at standard temperature and pressure (STP)?\nWhat is the density of water at standard temperature and pressure (STP)?\nWhat is the difference between gauge and absolute pressure?\nWhat is the mathematical definition of (equation for) pressure?\nWhat is the mathematical equation for the pressure at depth  \\(h\\) in a fluid?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile at the beach, you push a beach ball under the surface of the water and notice that it is quite hard to keep submerged. What is exerting an upward force on the ball. (Don’t just say buoyant force!!)\nWhat determines whether an object float or sinks when placed in a fluid?\nTwo blocks are identical in size. One is made of lead and sits on the bottom of a pond; the other is made of wood and floats on top. Upon which block is the buoyant force greater? Explain.\nWhat is Archimedes’ principle?\nTwo objects are floating in water. Half of object #1 is submerged in the water and 75% of object #2 is submerged. Which object is more dense? Can you prove it mathematically?\n(T/F) The buoyant force on a submerged object depends on both its size and shape?\n\n\n\n\n\nA fluid is flowing through a pipe that has a narrow section and a wider section. Why does the speed of the fluid increase in the narrow section and decrease in the wider section of the pipe?\nWhat is the equation for volume flow rate? (related question: What are the SI units of volume flow rate?)\nWhat is the mathematical formula for Bernoulli’s equation?\nA pipe starts at the bottom of a hill and continues until it reaches the top. The pipe is wide at the bottom and narrow at the top. Compare the pressure and flow speed at the top and bottom.\nDraw a Venturi tube and explain how it works.\nUse Bernoulli’s principle (equation) to explain how an airplane wing (airfoil) generates lift.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the mathematical equation and SI units for tensile stress?\nWhat is the mathematical equation and SI units for volume stress?\nWhat is the mathematical equation and SI units for linear strain?\nWhat is the mathematical equation and SI units for volume strain?\nWhat is Young’s modulus and what are the SI units?\nWhat is Bulk modulus and what are the SI units?"
